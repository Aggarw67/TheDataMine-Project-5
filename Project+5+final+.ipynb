These were derived from\\n  photographs taken at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope between 1923\\n  and 1928.  It covers the astrographic zones -40 degrees to -52 degrees of\\n  declination.  The positions are given for epoch 1900 (1900.0).  It includes\\n  spectral types for many of the stars listed.  It extends the earlier\\n  catalogs derived from the same plates to fainter magnitudes.  The\\n  computer-readable version consists of a single data table.The stated probable error for the star positions is 0.024 seconds of time\\n  (R.A.) and 0.25 seconds of arc (dec.) for stars with one determination,\\n  0.017 seconds of time, and 0.18 seconds of arc for two determinations, and\\n  0.014 / 0.15 for stars with three determinations.The precession and secular variations were derived from Newcomb's constants.The authors quote probable errors of the proper motions in both coordinates\\n  of 0.008 seconds of arc for stars with one determination, 0.0055 seconds for\\n  stars with two determinations, and 0.0044 for stars with three.The photographic magnitudes were derived from the measured diameters on the\\n  photographic plates and from the magnitudes given in the Cape Photographic\\n  Durchmusterung.The spectral classification of the cataloged stars was done with the\\n  assistance of Annie Jump Cannon of the Harvard College Observatory.The user should consult the source reference for more details of the\\n  measurements and reductions.

       "3 Improved proper motions for the 1160 stars contained in the photometric\\n   catalog by Dickow et al. (1970) are presented. Most of the proper motions\\n   are from the GC, transferred to the system of FK4. For stars not included\\n   in the GC, preliminary AGK or SAO proper motions are given. Fogh Olsen\\n   (Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. Ser., 1, 189, 1970) describes the method of\\n   improvement. The mean errors of the centennial proper motions increase with\\n   increasing magnitude. In Right Ascension, these range from 0.0043/cos(dec)\\n   for very bright stars to 0.096/cos(dec) for the faintest stars. In Dec-\\n   lination, the range is from 0.065 to 1.14.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4 This catalog of 3356 faint stars was derived from meridian circle\\n   observations at the Bergedorf and Heidelberg Observatories. The\\n   positions are given for the equinox 1950 on the FK3 system. The stars\\n   are mainly between 8.0 and 10.0 visual magnitude. A few are brighter\\n   than 8.0 mag. The lower limit in brightness resulted from the visibility\\n   of the stars.All stars were observed at both the Heidelberg and Bergedorf\\n   Observatories. Normally, at each observatory, two observations were\\n   obtained with the clamp east and two with the clamp west. The mean\\n   errors are comparable for the two observatories with no significant\\n   systematic difference in the positions between them. The mean errors of\\n   the resulting positions should be approximated 0.011s/cos(dec) in right\\n   ascension and ).023\" in declination.The proper motions were derived from a comparison with the catalog\\n   positions with the positions in the AGK2 and AGK2A with a 19 year\\n   baseline and from a comparison of new positions with those in Kuestner\\n   1900 with about a fifty year baseline.The magnitudes were taken from the AGK2. Most spectral types were\\n   determined by A. N. Vyssotsky. A few are from the Bergedorfer\\n   Spektraldurchmusterung.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
